	Make sure to run only one instance of the LDPlayer. 
	You can cover the emulator window with other windows, but do not minimize it to tray. You can move it elsewhere. 
	Player interactions with the game are possible but not recommended. 

	Do not hide the vertical panel on the right side of the LDPlayer with window controls (where the Home and Back buttons are located) 
	as it is used by TinyClicker in cases when the restart of the game is needed. Restart is performed automatically when certain ads refuse to 
	close or any other unexpected behaivour of the game occurs.


	SETUP:

     1. Prior to launching the clicker, set the LDPlayer resolution setting to Customize, with Width = 333, Height = 592, DPI = 150.
	It is also recommended to set the "Fixed window size" to "Enable" at the "Other settings" tab, to prevent accidental resolution change.
	This is important and TinyClicker won't work without the correct resolution.

     2. If you don't have the VIP Tiny Tower package, open the file Config.txt, located inside the TinyClicker folder with notepad.
	Locate the "VipPackage": setting and change it to "false" without quotes. If you have the VIP package set the setting to true. 
	You can also provide the current number of floors (e.g. 14 or 27 etc) for automatic tower rebuilding and the elevator speed (e.g. 7.25 or 6 etc).
	Only use the format provided by examples in brackets.

     3. When setup is done, simply launch LDPlayer, then the game and lastly the clicker. 
	This setup is done once unless some of the parameters such as elevator speed or VIP status changes.
